# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (MEAN STACK) IN AWS
In this project, we will implement a web solution based on the MEAN stack in AWS Cloud. MEAN Web stack consists of the following components:

1. MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents, (Document database) – Stores and allows retrieval of data.
2. ExpressJS:(Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
3. Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests.
4. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser – Accepts requests and displays results to end user.
